# InvioFilm

The user is greeted with the movie search screen. On this screen, the user specifies the movie they want to search. Then the results are displayed in the list at the bottom of the search screen and the details of the movie can be accessed.

## What did I do?
1. I designed a logo.
2. I developed with SwiftUI.
3. I used the MVVM design pattern.
4. I fetched movie and series information using omdb api. http://www.omdbapi.com/
5. i used lottie for animations.
6. I used screen transition animation.
7. I took care to write clean code.
